## Circuit Components

1. **AC Voltage Source (V1):**
   - Type: Sine wave generator
   - Voltage: Adjustable amplitude
   - Purpose: Provides the input signal for amplification.

2. **Resistors:**
   - **R1 (40kΩ):** Provides the base bias current for the transistor.
   - **R2 (270Ω):** Limits the emitter current and stabilizes the operating point.
   - **R3 (10kΩ):** Acts as the load resistor, determining the output voltage.

3. **Capacitors:**
   - **C1 (25µF):** Couples the AC input signal to the base of the transistor while blocking DC components.
   - **C2 (25µF):** Couples the amplified output signal to the load while blocking DC components.

4. **Transistor (Q1):**
   - Model: 2N3904 (NPN)
   - Purpose: Amplifies the input signal by controlling the collector current based on the base current.

5. **DC Voltage Source (VCC):**
   - Voltage: 5V
   - Purpose: Provides power to the circuit.

6. **Oscilloscope:**
   - Channels:
     - **Channel A (Vin):** Displays the input signal.
     - **Channel B (Vb):** Shows the base voltage of the transistor.
     - **Channel C (Vout):** Displays the amplified output signal.
   - Purpose: Analyzes the input, base, and output waveforms.

## How the Circuit Works

1. **Input Signal (Vin):**
   - An AC signal is applied to the base of the transistor through the coupling capacitor (C1). 
   - The capacitor blocks any DC component, ensuring only the AC signal reaches the transistor.

2. **Amplification:**
   - The transistor amplifies the small input signal.
   - Proper biasing using R1 and R2 ensures the transistor operates in the active region.

3. **Output Signal (Vout):**
   - The amplified signal is available at the collector of the transistor.
   - The output is coupled to the load resistor (R3) through the coupling capacitor (C2), which blocks DC and passes only the amplified AC signal.

---

## Observations

1. **Input vs. Output:**
   - The input signal (Vin) has a smaller amplitude compared to the amplified output (Vout).
   - The base voltage (Vb) is properly biased to ensure stable operation.

2. **Amplified Signal:**
   - The oscilloscope shows an amplified signal at the output (Vout) with minimal distortion.

## Key Formula

### Voltage Gain:
The voltage gain of the circuit can be calculated as:
\[
A_v = \frac{R3}{R2}
\]
Where:
- \( A_v \): Voltage gain
- \( R3 \): Load resistor
- \( R2 \): Emitter resistor

### Cutoff Frequency:
The cutoff frequency of the coupling capacitors can be determined using:
\[
f_c = \frac{1}{2 \pi R C}
\]
Where:
- \( f_c \): Cutoff frequency
- \( R \): Resistance
- \( C \): Capacitance

3. Run the simulation.
4. Use the oscilloscope to observe:
   - **Channel A (Vin):** Input signal.
   - **Channel B (Vb):** Base voltage.
   - **Channel C (Vout):** Amplified output signal.
5. Adjust the input signal amplitude or frequency to analyze the circuit's behavior.

## Planned Updates

1. Add a frequency response analysis to observe the behavior at different frequencies.
2. Implement a feedback network to improve the stability of the amplifier.
3. Add a more detailed analysis of phase shift and distortion.

# LM393 Light Detection Comparator Circuit

This project demonstrates a basic light detection circuit using an LM393 comparator. The circuit compares a reference voltage with a simulated light-dependent voltage to switch an LED on or off.

## 🔧 Components Used

| Component        | Value       | Purpose                           |
|------------------|-------------|------------------------------------|
| LM393            | Dual Comparator | Core comparator logic             |
| Potentiometer    | 1kΩ         | Acts as a variable reference voltage (Vref) |
| DC Voltage Source| 1V          | Simulates input from a solar cell (Vin) |
| Resistor R2      | 330Ω        | Current limiting resistor for the LED |
| LED              | Green       | Output indicator (on in dark / Vin < Vref) |
| Vcc              | 5V          | Power supply for LM393             |
| GND              | -           | Ground reference                   |

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Non-inverting input (+) of LM393 is connected to the output of the potentiometer (adjustable Vref).
- Inverting input (−) is connected to a fixed DC voltage source (simulating solar/light sensor).
- Output goes LOW when Vin > Vref → LED turns off.
- Output goes HIGH (via pull-up inside LM393 or external resistor) when Vin < Vref → LED turns on.

## 🧪 Simulation Notes

- This schematic assumes:
  - Pull-up mechanism is handled internally or by LED path.
  - The voltage difference between V+ and V− determines the output.

| Condition         | LED State |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Vin (−) > Vref (+)| OFF       |
| Vin (−) < Vref (+)| ON        |

## 📌 Applications

- Solar light controllers (auto ON in dark)
- Light-sensitive switch circuits
- Comparator-based control logic

## 💡 Notes

- To simulate real-world behavior, replace the fixed voltage (V1) with a solar cell.
- Add a pull-up resistor (e.g., 10kΩ) to the comparator output for reliable switching, if not already present through the LED path.
